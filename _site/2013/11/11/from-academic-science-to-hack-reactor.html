          <h2>From academic science to hack reactor</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Nov 2013</p>
<div class="post">
<p>A few weeks ago, I promised I’d give more information into my career shift, but wasn’t able to briefly encapsulate all the thoughts that led to my decision, so here’s my attempt at logging that thought process. Recently, I decided to transition out of my post-doctoral research fellowship position at UCSF in order to attend - in my opinion - the leading programming bootcamp, Hack Reactor in San Francisco.</p>

<p>So, first off: Why did I choose to transition out of my academic postdoc? Well, for many reasons, actually. Suffice to say that I was able to handle the poor work-life balance, poor pay, and poor future job prospects in academic science when I was younger, but lately my apprehension about it became too great for me to ignore any longer.</p>

<p>So I began to think about what skills I had that I could develop for a possible career transition.  One thing I kept going back to was that I thoroughly enjoyed the computer science classes I took almost a decade ago at Georgia Tech, and always enjoyed writing data analysis code for my neuroscience research.  So I felt that I had some skills when it came to converting ideas into code, but didn’t feel confident enough yet to dive into a developer position because I felt I lacked a thorough understanding of programming principles and did not have enough relevant experience.</p>

<p>It was in this mindset that I started searching for online computer science tutorials, MOOCs, or other ways to gain a solid programming foundation.  That’s when I first heard about the so-called “coding bootcamps”: programs that promised to turn you from a novice to a junior web developer capable of getting a job in the tech industry in only 12 weeks of intense study.  Many of these schools have popped up in the past 2 years, but the more I researched, one school kept impressing me more and more: Hack Reactor.</p>

<p>Their reputation is that it is not a school for absolute beginners (not 0 to 60, more like 20 to 120).  They believe in training future software engineers, not simply web developers. Most programming bootcamps go ~8 hours a day / 5 days a week for 9 or 12 weeks.  Hack Reactor goes 12-13 hours a day / 6 days a week for 12 weeks. Their job placement and salary numbers were the most impressive. At every turn, it seemed to me that Hack Reactor was pushing the envelope further than any other school, which in my mind would translate to me becoming a more capable engineer.</p>

<p>I applied and, thankfully, was accepted to their November 2013 - February 2014 cohort.  It’s going to be quite a ride, and I plan to update this blog with my experiences throughout the course (most likely on my one day off a week, Sundays).  So, if you are interested in making a similar transition or are just curious about how it’s going, stay tuned here or follow me on twitter (see below)!</p>
